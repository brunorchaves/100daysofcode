This is my repository for the 100 day code challenge. My Goals are
- [ ] Have strong knowledge of AI, ML and CV basics
- [ ] Be able to implement these areas in my projects 
- [ ] Have confidence to talk about these subjects
- [ ] Learn a little about in Deep Learning

Top Repositories
- [Machine Learning]()
- [Computer-Vision](https://github.com/brunorchaves/Computer-Vision)
- [Robotics-with-Python]()
- [Data Science]()



My subprojects:
- [Eye gaze tracker mouse](https://github.com/brunorchaves/eye_gaze_mouse)
- [Myo hand gesture classifier](https://github.com/brunorchaves/myo_predictor)
- [Recomendation system]()
- [Head gesture classifier]()
- [Text suggestion]()
- [ ]
